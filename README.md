# Tweets-Disaster-or-Not with Naive Bayes and LSTM
'Tweets disaster or not' is a classification data set provided by kaggle team as a part of competition. Objective of this objective is given a tweet, model should predict whether a tweet announces disaster or not.
I have trained the model with a machine learning algorithm - Naive Bayes and deep learning - LSTM.
After training model and comparing, Navie Bayes out-performed with f1-score of 0.80163.
